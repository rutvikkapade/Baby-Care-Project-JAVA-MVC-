							<h3>Indore- Where History Reveals its Glory</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								The history of Indore reveals that the ancestors of the founders of the city were the Zamindars and indigenous landholders of Malwa. Indore popularly known as “Mini Bombay” is a tier II city, the largest city of Indian State of Madhya Pradesh by population. Indore wields a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education and entertainment, and has been described as commercial capital of the state. Indore is the only city in India to host both, Indian Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Management.
