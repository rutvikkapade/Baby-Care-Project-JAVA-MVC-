					<h3 class="text-heading">ROBO WAR</h3>
					<H2>Problem statement :</H2>
					<p class="sample-text">The Challenge is to build a robot competent enough to battle other robots in the RoboWar challenge. The competition is carried out in a tournament format: competitors bring their wireless or wired robots ready to battle and are pitted against their competitors robots in one-on-one matches where the aim is to cause maximum damage or to push the opponent's robot off the arena to score maximum points. The robots can be manually operated or autonomous.</p>
					<br>
					<H2>Team Details :</H2>
					<p class="sample-text">
						A team consists of maximum four members. Each team must have a captain. </p>
						<p class="sample-text">Each member should belong from same college/Institution.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Game Play</h2>
					<br>
<h2>Battle Time:</h2>
<p class="sample-text">Battle time is the maximum time allotted for the robots to fight and be in the arena. Battle time does not stop ideally, however can be stopped by the referee under critical circumstances. 
First Round: There will be a knock out if the number of teams goes more than 16. Out of these 16 teams, top 6 teams will be allowed to fight in final round. 
Second Round: In case the number of participating teams is less than 16, the teams will enter second round directly.
Winning team will be decided on the basis of maximum score gained in the second round only. However in case of tie the scores of first round will also be considered or There will be a match played against the two tie teams.</p>
<br>
<b>*No battle will be played if the number of teams is less 6.</b>
<br>
<h2>Pre-Game play:</h2>
<p class="sample-text">All teams must be present and ready for the first battle within five (5) minutes of the first announcement. A Team's failure to appear within this time frame is considered a loss for that Team. Additional delay may be permitted by the Referee, at his discretion.
Each Robot will be inspected by the referee to check any possible violation of rules by the team, if any violation is observed the referee reserves the right to suggest the necessary changes to be made on the robot or disqualify the robot.</p>
<br>
<h2>Game procedure:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">
Each Round of the competition will be a knockout round of 10mins divided into two five minutes battle round in which two team will engage in a head to head battle.
The main objective of robots will be to immobilize the opponent's robot for at least 30 seconds or score maximum points by damaging or pushing it out of the battlefield.
Once the competition starts, robot must move (at least 1 inch) within 30 seconds, else the robot will be flagged immobilized and will lose the match by knockout.
The robot is considered out of the ring if every part of it crosses the defined area/battlefield boundary. A robot whose body is hanging off the boundary of the battlefield is not considered out of the battlefield.
All judgments rendered by the Referee regarding whether a robot has Lost the Battle or a round is complete, will be final and should not be appealed for justification or discussion.
Each team may ask the referee to pause the game, referee may or may not grant the pause based on the severity of the situation.
In each round team scoring maximum points will be qualified to play the next round.</p>
<br>
<h2>Robot specifications</h2>
<p class="sample-text">The team must build and bring one pre-constructed, autonomous or manual, wireless or wired robot whose purpose is to push, throw, flip, hit, drag or otherwise move the opponent out of the battle ring within the maximum battle time. The following section details the rules and specifications regarding the robot; please be sure to read them carefully and refer to them as you design your robot. The robot should not be of jumping and hopping type.</p>
<br>
<h2>Technical Inspection:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Robots must pass a technical inspection by the Referee and/or assigned Staff prior to being permitted to compete. The Referee would check whether the size of the robot is matching the criteria, any loosen component, possible impact of attack which may cross the safety area etc.
Robots that fail technical inspection may not compete until the Team rectifies identified problems and passes a re-inspection. There are no limits on the number of re-inspections; however, as soon as a team fails, inspecting Staff members will move to the next robot to be inspected. This rule does not extend or invalidate any time limits during the Competition.</p>
<br>
<h2>Size & weight constraints:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">
The robots must fit in a box with dimension: 30 CM X 30 CM X 30 CM at the beginning of a Battle. There are no size constraints once the Battle has begun, robot can expand its parts after the battle starts.
Nothing can intentionally detach from the robot. Robots will not be immediately penalized if pieces detach as a result of breakage. In the case of repeated breakage, the Referee may invalidate a Battle, request certain remedies be taken, or disqualify the Team
The maximum weight allowed is 20kg excluding batteries. Weight will be measured at the time of inspection before starting the competition.
The robot can be autonomous or manual. It should have external source of control that is wireless or wired remote control.</p>
<br>
<h2>Radio control requirements:</h2>
<p class="sample-text">
Radio systems MUST NOT cause interference to other frequency users. In RoboWars, only the 2.4ghz DSS (Digital Spread Spectrum) frequencies are allowed. Radio telemetry is permitted on 433MHz and 2.4GHz.
Autonomous/ Semi-Autonomous Robots:
If you are bringing an autonomous robot or a robot with significant autonomous functions, you need to ensure that the function of a robot, including drive and weapons, must have the capability of being remotely armed and disarmed. Also, when deactivated the robot should have no autonomous functions enabled, and all autonomous functions should fail safe to off if there is loss of power or radio signal.</p>
<h2>Electrical Power:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">The robot must be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed. All robots must incorporate a way that can be activated to remove/turning off power to all the weapon system and drive systems without causing harm to the human activating it. Voltage must not exceed 36V DC. Note that batteries may have a higher voltage during charging and care must be taken not to exceed these limits. Change of battery will not be allowed during the match however he can change the battery in between matches.</p>
<h2>Batteries:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Batteries can be mounted on the robot or off the robot. Wire used to connect batteries with the robot should be of high current rating to prevent wire damaging and short circuit during the battle. The design of robot must include a short circuit protection circuit for battery.
If the batteries are placed on the robot, it must be adequately protected within the body shell and securely fixed to minimize the chance of being punctured or coming loose during combat. In addition, packing such as high-density foam is recommended to reduce the shock of impacts. Battery terminals must be protected to prevent short circuits. Following battery types are allowed: </p>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">NiCad (Nickel-cadmium)</p> 
<p class="sample-text">NiMH (Nickel-metal Hydride)</p>
<p class="sample-text">Pb (Sealed Lead Acid)</p>
<p class="sample-text">LiFePo4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate)</p>
<p class="sample-text">LiPo (Lithium Polymer)</p>
<br>
<h2>WEAPONS: </h2>

<p class="sample-text">All high-speed weapons (e.g. all pneumatic/hydraulic/spring/flysheet and rotational weapons) must incorporate a secure restraint that holds the weapon in a safe position. The restraint may incorporate locking pins and bars but must be secured in such a way that it cannot be removed inadvertently. The design should ensure that the weapon must remain off in ideal conditions and functions only when activated by the controller.</p>
<br>
<h2>Pneumatics: </h2>
<p class="sample-text">Pneumatic systems must use Carbon Dioxide [CO2] or Air. The maximum pressure at any point within a pneumatics system must not exceed 12 bars (174 psi). The compressed gas shall be stored in a commercially manufactured gas cylinder of appropriate design, specification and certification. </p>
<br>
<h2 class="">Hydraulics:</h2>
<p class="sample-text">
	Hydraulic system pressure (In the actuator or cylinder) must be limited to 12bars (174 psi) by the means of maximum pressure relief valve. A hydraulic test point is a mandatory fitment to allow verification of a robot's maximum system pressure. A team will need its own test gauge and hose. Hydraulic fluid storage tanks must be of a suitable material and adequately guarded against rupture.</p>
	<br>
<h2>Springs and flywheels:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text"> Any large springs used for drive or weapon power must have a way of loading and actuating the spring remotely under the robot's power. Under no circumstances should a large spring be loaded when the robot is out of the arena or testing area. These devices must be made safe before removing the robot from the arena or testing area. Flywheels or similar kinetic energy storing devices must not be spinning or storing energy in any way, unless inside the arena or testing area. These devices must be made safe before removing the robot from the arena or testing area.
Flame System: Flame systems are allowed but should be implemented in a way that the gas tank must be leak proof and must be placed on the robot in such a way that it is protected against any damage or shocks in the game play. It is highly recommended to cover the tank with a protective covering which can withstand shocks caused during the game play. The organizer's holds the right to discard the robot or remove the flame system from the robot if found dangerous or unfit for the competition.
</p>
 <br>
<h2>Weapons Restrictions:</h2>

<br>
<h2>Smoke and Light:</h2>
 <p class="sample-text">Smoke and light-based weapons, which impair the viewing of robots by an Entrant, Judge, Official or Viewer are forbidden to use. This includes, but is not limited to; Smoke or Dust, Lights such as external lasers and bright strobe lights, which may blind the opponent.
Hazardous Materials: Hazardous or dangerous materials are forbidden from use anywhere on a robot where they may contact humans, or by way of the robot being damaged (within reason) contact humans.</p>
<p class ="sample-text"><b>Explosives: Explosives of any kind are not allowed as a weapon system for the robot.</b></p>
<br>

<h2>Arena Specification:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">The field area would be 12 ft x 12 ft. 
The arena surface is generally smooth but may have small irregularities.
There will be a white circle marking the battle area for the robots.
Battle area:
The area inside the marked white circle is referred as the battle area.
There will be a white circle marking the battle area for the robots.
Pit will be inside the Battle area.</p>
<br>

<h2>Pit:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">The Pit is a hole in the battle area designed to engulf robots when pushed inside it.
The dimension of the pit will be made in such a way that the robot does not get damaged when it falls inside the pit.</p>
<br>
<h2>Rules for the Game:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">
Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing.</p>
<br>
<h2>Team:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">The captain is the person responsible for communication with referees. The team can replace its captain during the competition. Team can have only two possible members beside the field during game play; they will usually be the captain and an assistant team member.</p>
<br>
<h2>Safety Inspections:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">In order to conduct the battle rounds safely, all the participants are requested to comply with the rules and technical checks of the robot before the battle or during the battle. It is at the inspector's sole discretion that your Robot can compete or not. As a maker you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff.
Staff may, at their discretion, require that any safety hazards to any person, robot, or object at the venue be addressed. This may include full removal of the components posing the hazard, disqualification of a robot if a danger is not addressed adequately, and removal of materials or persons from the premises.</p>
<br>
<h2>Robot maintenance:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Teams have approximately two (2) minute between battles. During this time, they may perform any adjustments they want to perform on their robot, with the explicit exception of altering the software of the robot in any way.
No technical inspections are permitted during this time, teams must not add or remove mechanisms or components except to replace them with identical components.
Teams that are not ready after time elapsed will receive a warning. On further violation of this time limit, the Referee may judge that the violating Team has forfeit the Match.
The only exception to both the time and technical inspection limitations are for readily correctable safety issues, as determined by Staff, for which contestants may be asked to remove or rectify hazardous or broken systems.</p>
<br>
<h2>Personal conduct:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Competitors are expected to demonstrate respect and good sportsmanship towards fellow Competitors, Staff, their possessions and the venue itself.
Competitors are required to follow Staff instructions regarding safety, acceptable conduct, or any other instructions to ensure smooth Competition proceedings.
Any Competitor who fails to follow the instructions will face penalties which may include verbal warnings, Match forfeiture, disqualification, or removal from the premises, depending on severity.</p>
<br>
<h2>Behavior:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Participants who misbehave may be asked to leave the competition area and risk disqualification.
The rules will be enforced at the discretion of the referees and officials.
All decisions about scoring, game play and timing are made by the juries. Teams should completely respect their vote and decisions. Members of the jury will be from different fields of the robotic science.</p>
<br>
<h2>Grading Policy:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">During the competition in each round, Robots will be engaged in a time battle. The winners will be decided by knockout. If the time runs out with no clear winner, Judges Decision would be the final. Points will be scored on the basis following norms.</p>
<br>
<h2>Game Points:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">Flip the Ring: Score 40 Points by flipping opponent's robot out of the ring.</p>
<p class="sample-text">Pitfall: Score 30 Points by maneuvering opponent's robot into the Pit inside the battle area. The robot will remain in the pit for 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="sample-text">Arena Weapon: Score 20 points for damaging the opponent's robot using the arena weapon. </p>
<p class="sample-text">Freestyle (100 points Max): Showcasing abilities and enthralling the audience and judges with their robot. </p>
<p class="sample-text">Aggression (100 points Max.): Aggression is judged by the frequency, severity, boldness, and effectiveness of attacks deliberately initiated by the robot against its opponent. If a robot appears to have accidentally attacked an opponent, that act will not be considered Aggression.</p> 
<p class="sample-text">Defense (100 points Max.): The robot exhibits a combat plan that exploits the robot's attack plan. The 'defense' is also defined as a robot exhibiting a deliberate defense plan that guards its weaknesses against the strengths of the opponent. </p>
<p class="sample-text">Damage (100 points Max.): Through deliberate action, a robot either directly or indirectly reduces the functionality, effectiveness or defensibility of an opponent. Damage is not considered relevant if a robot inadvertently harms itself. Also, if a pressure vessel or a rapidly spinning device on a robot fragments, any damage to the opponent will not be considered 'deliberate'.</p> 
<p class="sample-text">Control/Strategy (100 Points Max): Control means a robot is able to attack an opponent at its weakest point, use its weapons in the most effective way, and minimize the damage caused by the opponent or its weapons.</p> 
<p class="sample-text">Out of Ring (100 Max): The team will gain 50 points for each push out of the battle ring, however the maximum score for this is 100 points. If the team pushes the opponents robot out of the ring five times, the opponent will be considered as knock out.</p>
<br>
<h2>Certification Policy:</h2>
<br>
<p class="sample-text">
Top two teams will be awarded by certification of excellence and cash prize for the event. 
All teams will be provided by certificate of participation. </p><br>
